# Melanoma Detection Project


## Problem Statement
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow for multiclass classification with the primary focus on accurately detecting melanoma. Melanoma, a type of cancer, poses a significant threat as it accounts for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates, making automated evaluation systems vital in aiding dermatologists to identify melanoma promptly.

This project aims to:

- Design and implement a CNN-based model capable of accurately detecting melanoma from images.
- Explore various architectural configurations and hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
- Assess the model's efficacy in correctly identifying melanoma cases, thereby reducing the need for manual intervention in diagnosis.
- Investigate the potential of the developed solution to assist dermatologists by providing timely alerts about the presence of melanoma in medical images.
- Contribute towards the development of automated tools for medical image analysis, facilitating early detection and intervention in critical conditions like melanoma.

## Conclusions
- Treating class imbalance has affected the accuracy and made it stable at an extent.
- Accuracy has increased and is stable.
- Further the model can be enhanced with more layers, neurons and hyperparameters.

## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow 2.14.0
- NumPy 1.19.2
